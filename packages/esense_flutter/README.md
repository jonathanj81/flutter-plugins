# eSense Flutter

This plugin supports the [eSense](https://www.esense.io) earable computing platform on both Android and iOS.

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/esense_flutter.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/esense_flutter)

## Install (Flutter)

Add `esense_flutter` as a dependency in  `pubspec.yaml`.
For help on adding as a dependency, view the [pubspec documenation](https://flutter.io/using-packages/).

## Android

The package uses bluetooth to fetch data from the eSense earplugs.
Therefore permission to access bluetooth must be enabled.

Add the following entry to your `manifest.xml` file, in the Android part of your application:

```xml
<uses-permission
    android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH"
    android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
<uses-permission
    android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN"
    android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
<uses-permission
    android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN" 
    android:usesPermissionFlags="neverForLocation" /> 
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT"/>
```

Also make sure to obtain permissions in your app to use bluetooth.
See the example app on how to e.g. use the [`permission_handler`](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler) for this. Note that the plugin **does not** handle permissions - this has to be done on an app level.

Set the Android compile and minimum SDK versions to `compileSdkVersion 28`,
and `minSdkVersion 23` respectively, inside the `android/app/build.gradle` file.

## iOS

Requires iOS 10 or later. Hence, in your `Podfile` in the `ios` folder of your app, make sure that the platform is set to `10.0`.

```
platform :ios, '10.0'
```

Add this permission in the `Info.plist` file located in `ios/Runner`:

```xml
<key>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>Uses bluetooth to connect to the eSense device</string>
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
  <array>
 <string>bluetooth-central</string>
 <string>bluetooth-peripheral</string>
  <string>audio</string>
  <string>external-accessory</string>
  <string>fetch</string>
</array>
```

Note that on iOS, connecting to the eSense device may take several seconds.

## Usage

The eSense Flutter plugin has been designed to resemble the Android eSense API almost **1:1**. Hence, you should be able to recognize the names of the different classes and class variables.  
For example, the methods on the [`ESenseManager`](https://pub.dev/documentation/esense/latest/esense/ESenseManager-class.html) class is mapped 1:1.
See the [eSense Android documentation](https://www.esense.io/share/eSense-Android-Library.pdf) on how it all works.

However, one major design change has been done; this eSense Flutter plugin complies to the Dart/Flutter reactive programming architecture using [Stream](https://api.dartlang.org/stable/2.4.0/dart-async/Stream-class.html)s.
Hence, you do not 'add listeners' to an eSense device (as you do in Java) -- rather, you obtain a Dart stream and listen to this stream (and exploit all the [other very nice stream operations](https://dart.dev/tutorials/language/streams) which are available in Dart).
Below, we shall describe how to use the eSense streams.
But first -- let's see how to set up and connect to an eSense device in the first place.

Note that playing and recording audio are performed via the Bluetooth Classic interface and are not supported by the eSense library described here.

### Setting up and Connecting to an eSense Device

All operations on the eSense device happens via the [`ESenseManager`](https://pub.dev/documentation/esense/latest/esense/ESenseManager-class.html).
When creating the `ESenseManager`, specify the name of the device (typically on the form `eSense-xxxx`).

```dart
import 'package:esense_flutter/esense.dart';

...

// create an ESenseManager by specifying the name of the device
ESenseManager eSenseManager = ESenseManager('eSense-0332');

...

// first listen to connection events before trying to connect
eSenseManager.connectionEvents.listen((event) {
  print('CONNECTION event: $event');
}

...

// try to connect to the eSense device 
bool connecting = await eSenseManager.connect();
```

Everything with the eSense API happens asynchronously. Hence, the `connect` call merely initiates the connection
process. In order to know the status of the connection process (successful or not), you should listen to
connection events ([`ConnectionEvent`](https://pub.dev/documentation/esense/latest/esense/ConnectionEvent-class.html)).
This is done via the [`connectionEvents`](https://pub.dev/documentation/esense/latest/esense/ESenseManager/connectionEvents.html) stream.
Note, that if you want to know if your connection to the device is successful, you should initiate listening
**before** the connection is initiated, as shown above.

### Listen to Sensor Events

You can access a stream of [`SensorEvent`](https://pub.dev/documentation/esense/latest/esense/SensorEvent-class.html) events via the [`ESenseManager.sensorEvents`](https://pub.dev/documentation/esense/latest/esense/ESenseManager/sensorEvents.html) stream.
Sampling rate can be set when not listening.

`````dart
StreamSubscription subscription = eSenseManager.sensorEvents.listen((event) {
  print('SENSOR event: $event'
});

...

subscription.cancel();
eSenseManager.setSamplingRate(5);

... 

subscription = eSenseManager.sensorEvents.listen((event) {
  print('SENSOR event: $event');
});
`````

### Read eSense Device Events

Reading properties of the eSense device happens asynchronously. Hence, in order to obtain properties, you should
do two things:

  1. listen to the [`ESenseManager.eSenseEvents`](https://pub.dev/documentation/esense/latest/esense/ESenseManager/eSenseEvents.html) stream
  2. invoke read operation on the `ESenseManager`
  
Invoking read operations will trigger [`ESenseEvent`](https://pub.dev/documentation/esense/latest/esense/ESenseEvent-class.html) events of various kinds.

`````dart
// set up a event listener
eSenseManager.eSenseEvents.listen((event) {
  print('ESENSE event: $event');
}

// now invoke read operations on the manager
eSenseManager.getDeviceName();
`````

When the button on the eSense device is pressed, the `eSenseEvents` stream will send an [`ButtonEventChanged`](https://pub.dev/documentation/esense/latest/esense/ButtonEventChanged-class.html) event.

### Change the Configuration of the eSense Device

The [`ESenseManager`](https://pub.dev/documentation/esense/latest/esense/ESenseManager-class.html) exposes methods
to change the configuration of the eSense device.
With the plugin, you can change the device name using [`setDeviceName()`](https://pub.dev/documentation/esense/latest/esense/ESenseManager/setDeviceName.html),
change the advertising and connection interval using [`setAdvertisementAndConnectiontInterval()`](https://pub.dev/documentation/esense/latest/esense/ESenseManager/setAdvertisementAndConnectiontInterval.html),
and change the IMU sensor configuration using [`setSensorConfig()`](https://pub.dev/documentation/esense/latest/esense/ESenseManager/setSensorConfig.html).

**Note:** At the time of writing, the `setSensorConfig()` method is _not_ implemented.

### Limitations in the eSense BTLE interface

Note that there is a limitation to the eSense BTLE interface which implie that you **should not**
invoke methods on the ESenseManager in a fast pace after each other.
For example, the following code **will not work**:

`````dart
// set up a event listener
eSenseManager.eSenseEvents.listen((event) {
  print('ESENSE event: $event');
}

// now invoke read operations on the manager
// THIS WILL NOT WORK!
eSenseManager.getDeviceName();
eSenseManager.getAccelerometerOffset();
eSenseManager.getAdvertisementAndConnectionInterval();
`````

In this case, the first operation (listening to the Esense Events) will succeed - the rest will fail.
In the example app, this has been fixed by adding delays to method call, like;

```dart
// get the battery level every 10 secs
Timer.periodic(Duration(seconds: 10), (timer) async => await eSenseManager.getBatteryVoltage());

// wait 2, 3, 4, 5, ... secs before getting the name, offset, etc.
// it seems like the eSense BTLE interface does NOT like to get called
// several times in a row -- hence, delays are added in the following calls
Timer(Duration(seconds: 2), () async => await eSenseManager.getDeviceName());
Timer(Duration(seconds: 3), () async => await eSenseManager.getAccelerometerOffset());
Timer(Duration(seconds: 4), () async => await eSenseManager.getAdvertisementAndConnectionInterval());
Timer(Duration(seconds: 5), () async => await eSenseManager.getSensorConfig());
```
